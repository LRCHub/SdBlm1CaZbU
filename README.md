[00:08.72] Lately
[00:10.37] I've noticed that you smile at your phone screen
[00:14.81] More frequently
[00:16.76] And our favourite things are
[00:19.18] Nothing like the texts you get
[00:21.39] When you think I'm asleep, but
[00:36.39] 
[00:25.97] You swear they're from a friend
[00:28.40] As you turn the phone away
[00:30.73] If that's a friend then I'm dead weight
[00:50.23] 
[00:34.32] I hear what you aren't saying
[00:36.21] See you being shady
[00:38.18] But let it be
[00:39.90] 'Cause I'm too weak, so
[00:42.75] I kiss your head on your way out
[00:44.85] But can't ask you where you've been
[00:46.35] 'Cause I believe
[00:48.45] That what I don't know
[00:49.68] Can't hurt me
[00:56.18] 
[00:50.72] For months now
[00:52.52] You haven't left your phone without its face down
[00:56.53] And its ringer off
[00:59.28] And when you changed your hair
[01:01.23] I blamed the change of pace
[01:03.00] 'Cause I can't lose you to something
[01:06.22] That's in my head
[01:14.72] 
[01:08.13] I don't need to know
[01:10.48] The reason you've changed
[01:12.88] But if it's him, then I'm too late
[01:29.88] 
[01:16.15] I hear what you aren't saying
[01:18.00] See you being shady
[01:19.93] But let it be
[01:21.88] 'Cause I'm too weak, so
[01:24.16] I kiss your head on your way out
[01:26.55] But can't ask you where you've been
[01:28.23] 'Cause I believe
[01:30.15] That what I don't know
[01:31.54] Can't hurt me
[01:38.04] 
[01:34.10] Oh-oh
[01:36.06] Oh-oh-ohoooo
[01:38.57] (What I don't know can't hurt me)
[01:42.31] Oh-oh
[01:44.18] Oh-oh-ohoooo
[01:46.75] (What I don't know can't hurt me)
[02:03.25] 
[01:49.81] Maybe from a far
[01:52.23] I made a mistake
[01:54.71] (Yeah)
[01:58.37] It's all in my head
[02:00.79] You love me the same
[02:04.59] (Yeah)
[02:07.59] 
[02:06.39] I hear what you aren't saying
[02:08.32] See you being shady
[02:10.03] But let it be
[02:12.38] 'Cause I'm too weak so
[02:14.65] I kiss your head on your way out
[02:16.74] But can't ask you where you've been
[02:18.31] 'Cause I believe
[02:20.19] That what I don't know
[02:21.63] Can't hurt me
[02:28.13] 
[02:22.98] I see what you think I'm missing
[02:25.16] And it hurts like crazy
[02:26.52] But I won't plead
[02:28.91] I'd rather be (oh)
[02:31.32] Calling to see when you'll be back
[02:33.20] Then asking where you've been
[02:35.07] 'Cause I believe
[02:36.85] That what I don't know
[02:38.44] Can't hurt me
[02:44.94] 
[02:40.91] Oh-oh
[02:43.35] Oh-oh-ohoooo
[02:45.70] (What I don't know can't hurt me)
[03:02.20] 
[02:47.98] Don't mean to lead you on
[02:49.96] I know we're too far gone
[02:52.08] Just wanna think we're not (what I don't know can't hurt me)
[02:54.14] Don't blame me
[03:01.14] 
[02:56.58] Don't mean to lead you on
[02:58.62] I know we're too far gone
[03:00.65] Just wanna think we're not
[03:02.36] 'Cause what I don't know
[03:03.11] Can't hurt me
